        and clinical depression. Elliot is recruited by an insurrectionary anarchist known as "Mr. Robot", played<br/>

        <p><i>Further information: List of Mr. Robot episodes</i></p>
        <p>The series follows Elliot Alderson, a young man living in New York City, who works at the cybersecurity<br/>
        company Allsafe as a cybersecurity engineer. Constantly struggling with social anxiety, dissociative identity<br/>
        disorder and clinical depression, Elliot's thought process seems heavily influenced by paranoia and delusion.<br/>
        He connects to people by hacking them, which often leads him to act as a cyber-vigilante. He is recruited by<br/>
        a mysterious insurrectionary anarchist known as Mr. Robot and joins his team of hacktivists known as <i>fsociety</i>.<br/>
        One of their missions is to cancel all consumer debt by encrypting all the data of one of the largest corporations<br/>
        in the world, E Corp (which Elliot perceives as Evil Corp), which also happens to be Allsafe's biggest client.
